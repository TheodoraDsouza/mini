    <h2>What is your return policy?</h2>
    <p>Since we sell food items, we don’t accept returns. However, if there is an issue with your order, please let us know and we’ll do whatever we can to make it right for you. For all shipping-related questions, please visit our Shipping Policy Page for any additional information you might be looking for.</p>
    <h2>Can I checkout with shipping for multiple addresses?</h2>
    <p>Currently, our checkout only supports single addresses for shipping at checkout. To ship to multiple addresses, you will need to place multiple orders. We know this is a feature that many of our customers desire and are working on a solution to be able to offer this feature while maintaining our checkout security for all of our customers.</p>
    <h2>General Questions</h2>
    <h3>How long do your chocolates last? How quickly should they be consumed upon receiving?</h3>
    <p>We recommend enjoying our bonbons within 2 weeks of receiving them for ultimate freshness. Our assortments contain fresh ganache, which only has a 2 – 4 week shelf life. The shelf life of other confections we produce varies by product. Here’s a guide to help:</p>
    <h3>How do I place an order?</h3>
You can order our products via our online store at www.lepure.in</a>. Our collection can be browsed by product category: Toffee collection, Dragees Collection, BonBons and Pralines, Spreads, Other confectionaries, Hampers.</p>

    <p>Note: only one message can be entered per order. At the current time, it is not possible to write multiple messages, so if you wish to do so you will have to submit two or more separate orders.</p>
