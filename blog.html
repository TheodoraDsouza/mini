        <h2>The Chocolate-Making Process</h2>
        <p>The journey from cacao bean to chocolate bar is a meticulous process that involves several steps. It all starts with the harvesting of cacao pods, which are then fermented and dried. The beans are roasted to bring out their rich flavors, followed by cracking, winnowing, and grinding to produce chocolate liquor. Depending on the type of chocolate being made, ingredients like milk, sugar, and cocoa butter are added. The mixture is then refined and tempered to achieve the perfect texture before being molded into delicious bars.</p>
